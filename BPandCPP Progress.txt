TODO for the day

- Smooth transition for entering and exiting vehicle
- Move work to github so I can work on source control at the same time. This will also allow me to use their system instead of a .txt file.
- Implement Full Inventory UI
- Dropping/Placing items

BONUS
- Niagara experimentation. Footsteps, random superpower, etc.
